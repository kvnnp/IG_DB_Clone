Data Types Exercises

1. What's a good use case for CHAR?
- CHAR is faster for fixed length text (e.g. State Abbreviations, Yes/No Flags, Sex, etc.). Otherwise, you'd use VARCHAR for any other situation.

2. FILL IN THE BLANKS
	CREATE TABLE inventory (
		item_name ___,
		price ___,
		quantity ___,
	);

	ANS:
		CREATE TABLE inventory(
			item_name VARCHAR(100),
			price DECIMAL(5, 2), # 5 numbers total, 2 places behind the decimal
			quantity INT,
		);

3. What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?
- Both functions have different ranges of time. DATETIME has a much larger range while TIMESTAMP starts from 1970 to 2038.
- TIMESTAMP also takes up less space and is used for meta-data when something is created or updated.

4. Print out the current time.
CURTIME()

5. Print out the current date (but NOT time).
CURDATE()

6. Print out the current day of the week. (The Number)
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%w') + 1;

7. Print out the current day of the week. (The Day Name)
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%W'); 

8. Print out the current day and time using this format: mm/dd/yyyy
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%m/%d/%Y');

9. Print out the current day and time using this format: January 2nd at 3:15, April 1st at 10:18
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%M %D at %h:%i');

10. Create a tweets table that stores: the tweet content, a username, time it was created
CREATE TABLE tweets(
	content VARCHAR(140),
	username VARCHAR(20),
	created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO tweets (content, username) VALUES('i had scrambled eggs as part of my breakfast', 'supapawa');
